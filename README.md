  <h1>NeroChat</h1>
  <h3>Effective chat system with colored text, ignore, whisper and chat logging, regex filters, anti-spam for anarchic servers</h3>

</div>

## Features

- Players can customize their chat message using various prefixes. As an example putting an '>' before a chat message
  will turn the text green (green-text). (Note: Does not change the color of player names).
- Players can whisper other players (defaults to a purple color).
- Players can ignore another player (works for both world and whisper chat). Ignore lists are persistent between logins.
  Players can also un-ignore a previously ignored player.
- Players can toggle chat on/off.
- Full permission support so that you can limit who has access to what colors / features.
- Filtering messages in public and private chat with REGEX.
- Ability to turn on the stealth filtering mode when the spammer will think that his messages are sent.
- Automatic dot and capital letter.
- Ability to ignore case in regular expressions, which will eliminate filtration bypasses.
- Folia Support
- PlaceholderApi support
- Personal and global message customization
- Configure that does not reset with plugin updates and multi-language support (credits: https://github.com/xGinko/BetterWorldStats)
- Anti-Caps System
